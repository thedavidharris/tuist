# Build schemes

Traditionally,
teams have resorted to scripts and tools like [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) to define a command line interface to interact with their projects.
At scale,
that approach results in complex, error-prone, untested, and hard to reason about automation code.
It's not the tools' fault though;
small teams don't have enough resources to keep tooling in a good shape and end up disregarding the quality of the automation code.
This often leads to frustration:
_release pipelines failing because of signing issues, unreproducible issues on CI, or non-deterministic results across environments._

**What if someone could take care of automation for you?**
That's what commands like build are for.
Since Tuist knows about your projects because you describe them using manifest files like `Project.swift`,
it can offer simple and streamline workflows that are standard across all Tuist projects.
And because Tuist owns those workflows,
it can optimize them without you having to do anything on your end.
Manifest files become the source of truth for both,
editing the projects in Xcode,
and interacting with them from the terminal.

## Command

Build is designed for zero-arguments.
If it's executed without passing any arguments,
we assume the intent of the developer is to build the project in the current directory, and we infer the arguments from there:

**Build the project in the current directory**

```bash
tuist build
```

**Build a scheme**

```bash
tuist build MyScheme
```
